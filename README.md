# Riichi in Command Line

Riichi in Command Line (RiCL) is a pet project to write a networked riichi autotable, entirely in C, that runs in the command line. The goal is for RiCL to be playable on a broad range of systems.

## Usage

Build the project using make, then run the generated executable
```
make
./target/ricl
```

## Development Goals

### Phase One
